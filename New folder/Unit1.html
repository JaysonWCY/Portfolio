							Unit 1 - 3 Discussion
							<h3>Refer to the article by Padhy et al. (2018), specifically Table 1, where the authors present a list of factors which they consider influence the reusability of a piece of object-oriented software.</h3>
<h3>In this collaborative discussion, you are required to prioritise this list, presenting your argument for the priorities assigned.</h3>
							<br>
							<p>1. Documentation in project (DIP) <br>
								Proper documentation will allow for better analysis and planning for reusability.</p>
								
								<p>2. Knowledge requirement (KR) <br>
								Stating the knowledge requirements gives a basis of the required technical skills needed while also possibly providing a small look into possible used processes.</p>
								
								<p>3. An algorithm used in the program (AP) <br>
								Reusable algorithms can be used as long as the use case is similar.</p>
								
								<p>4. Modules in the program (MIP) <br>
								Having modular external tools will allow for usage in many cases however, modules tend to have more specific uses as opposed to algorithms.</p>
								
								<p>5. Use in the data project (UD) <br>
								Frequently reused data can most likely be used again. However, the importance is not as high as MIP as most of the time having new data sets can provide new discoveries.</p>
								
								<p>6. Design patterns (DP) <br>
								Design patterns are general enough to be used multiple times, however, most times they have to be altered slightly to fit the use case.</p>
								
								<p>7. Architecture driven approach (ADP) <br>
								Similar to design pattern but on a larger scale.</p>
								
								<p>8. Models in the project (MP) <br>
								Models tend to be too specific to be reused.</p>
								
								<p>9. Test cases/ test designs (TCTD) <br>
								Most times for higher accuracy of the test, most test cases and designs are case specific.</p>
								
								<p>10. Requirement analysis (RA) <br>
								Requirements tend to be depending on needs and availability, which tends to vary case to case.</p>
								
								<p>11. Service contracts (SC) <br>
								As it involved many parties, more details are added. This makes it highly specific and not reusable.</p>
								
								<p>On reflection between my answers and my peerâ€™s answers, ADP should have a higher ranking than 7 as it is the basis of software reusability due to providing a solid framework as well as an understandable flow. This would then be followed by DP as it is seen as a scale version of ADP. Generally, KR and DIP tend to achieve relatively high rankings due to their strong ability to effectively transfer knowledge. Besides those, opinions seem to be very subjective and rankings tend to be very different from each other.</p>
