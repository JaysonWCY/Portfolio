							<h3>1. What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>The factors that determine the security of a programming language are the available tools and built-in features that promote security. A programming language that is built with security in mind will often be safer than one without.</p>
							<br>
							<h3>2. Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Python can be considered a secure programming language as there are many tools and built-in safety features, such as the <code>cryptography</code> module, which promote secure development. This, however, fully depends on how the language is used and the way the code is written. Python's security features need to be used properly by developers to maintain security.</p>
							<br>
							<h3>3. Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</h3>
							<br>
							<p>When considering the better programming language for creating operating systems, many factors should be considered, such as runtime performance, readability, ease of use, memory management, and overhead usage. Python tends to be easier to use and read, but it performs overall worse in terms of runtime and memory management. C, on the other hand, often performs better and allows more control over system resources, but it requires more effort and is more difficult to work with. For operating systems, C is generally preferred due to its low-level capabilities, whereas Python is better suited for higher-level applications.</p>
