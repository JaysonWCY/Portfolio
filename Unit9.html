            You can complete one or more of the following activities for
            inclusion in your e-portfolio. You can also share your work with
            your tutor for formative feedback.
          </h3>

          <h3>Activity 1</h3>
          <h3>
            How relevant is the cyclomatic complexity in object-oriented
            systems? Which alternative metrics do you consider to be more
            reflective of the complexity of a piece of code, in comparison to
            the number of independent paths through a program? Support your
            response using reference to the related academic literature.
          </h3>

          <h3>Activity 2</h3>
          <h3>
            To what extent is cyclomatic complexity relevant when developing
            object-oriented code?

          <p>
            Cyclomatic complexity is used to monitor the number of different
            flows of which a program follows while operating. This is used to
            measure the independent paths and is considered to portray how
            complicated or messy a system is.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of object-oriented programming, which focuses on
            reusability and making complex systems more modular, it is a useful
            tool. If there are so many paths that a code can follow, then it may
            be an indicator that the system is not modelled efficiently.
          </p>

          <p>
            The issues come as object-oriented programming tends to be more on a
            level of a single system path as opposed to the consideration of the
            system design as a whole. As an example, a system with many paths
            and features could still have very modular and easily understood
            code. It also doesnâ€™t consider other aspects such as inheritance and
            polymorphism.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, both cyclomatic complexity and object-oriented programming
            have the same goal of making clear, easy to read, and
            straightforward code, but both consider different aspects of a
            system, which does not massively coincide.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other metrics can be used to measure the complexity of
            object-oriented designs better, such as Weighted Methods per Class
            (WMC) or Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO).
