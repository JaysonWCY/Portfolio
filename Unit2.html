							Unit 2
							<h1 class="major">UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning</h1>
							<h3>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.<h3>
							<h3>Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.</h3>
							<br>

							<h2>1. Access Control (3.1)</h2> <h3>Ensuring that access is restricted based on security requirements. </h3>
							<p>This follows the rule of least privilege. This involves only authorizing users access to information and processes that they require and nothing more. This prevents untrustworthy users from leaking data and reduces the impact if data is leaked from someone, as they would not have access to all the data.</p>

							<h2>2. Governance of Information Security (3.23)</h2> <h3>Having a system to control an organisation's information security.</h3>
							<p>This normally is a credible third party that has the interest of the company in mind, which is not involved in the day-to-day operation, allowing for unbiased control of security systems.</p>

							<h2>3. Policy (3.53)</h2>
							<p>By applying effective policies, such as deactivating USB ports, organizations can help reduce the ways that data can be leaked.</p>

							<h2>4. Risk Communication and Consultation (3.65)</h2>
							<p>Without experience, risk tends to be highly unpredictable. The lack of experience can be overcome by communication and consultation. By sharing information, more well-informed decisions can be made to reduce risk.</p>

							<h2>5. Security Implementation Standard (3.73)</h2>
							<p>By following the industry standard, which has been built up through many iterations and experiences, data leaks can be greatly decreased.</p>
