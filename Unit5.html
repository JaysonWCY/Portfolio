							<h3>The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.</h3>
						<br>
						<p>Cyclomatic Complexity is still relevant in today’s usage mostly due to being able to point out the flow complexity of the code, helping identify parts of the code that do too much. However, by itself, cyclomatic complexity doesn’t take into other issues such as readability of the code, complex data structures, and other issues that can be found through other ways of testing. Cyclomatic complexity should be paired with multiple other tools such as having good standard code practises, refactoring, and using other methods of testing.</p>
