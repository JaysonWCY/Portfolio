            1. Discuss the ways in which data structures support object-oriented
            development. Use examples of three different data structures to
            contextualise your response.

            2. Create a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class.
            Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the
            following methods:
          </h3>

          <ul>
            <li>items()</li>
            <li>keys()</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>
            3. Read the article by Kampffmeyer & Zschaler (2007). Develop a
            program which allows a user to enter the properties which they
            require of a design pattern, and have the program make a
            recommendation. Your program should use a constructor to initialise
            attributes and assign values to variables based on input entered by
            the user.

          <p>
            Object-oriented programming follows the main principles of
            encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. These main principles
            are used to reach the goal of having organised, easily
            understandable, reusable, scalable code.
          </p>

          <p>
            The use of data structures helps provide a simple framework to
            manipulate and organise data. An example would be dictionaries. This
            allows the assigning of a value or attribute to an object, which can
            be used for data manipulation and organisation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lists, whether stacks or queues, allow for the consideration of the
            order to be of value. As lists can have a variable size, this allows
            for scalability. Lists also provide the possibility of iteration as
            the values can easily be changed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The usage of trees can help with polymorphism as well as
            inheritance. As the root node branches into children’s nodes, the
            children’s nodes will inherit attributes from the parent node.
            Polymorphism can be closely used with tree data structures as the
            nodes will have similar attributes.
