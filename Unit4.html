							<h3>1. What is ReDOS and what part do 'Evil Regex' play?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>ReDOS stands for regular expression denial of service. This is the exploitation of regular expressions (Regex) to gain control of a system by consuming huge amounts of the limited computational resource, which in turn prevents service to other users. This is a method used to take hostage of a system or to overall be a nuisance. Evil Regex can be used to cause exponential complexity or backtracking loops which causes a lot of resources to be taken up.</p>
							<br>
							<h3>2. What are the common problems associated with the use of regex? How can these be mitigated?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Common issues with regex are that it is very difficult to read as it tends not to be very intuitive. Regex also tend to pose as a problem for security as mentioned before. These can be prevented by sanitising user data and checking user inputs as closely as possible. </p>
							<br>
							<h3>3. How and why could regex be used as part of a security solution?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Regex can also be used as a security solution as it is also a tool that can be used to check user inputs to prevent unwanted forms of data. </p>
