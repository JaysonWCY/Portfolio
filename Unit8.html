							<h3>The (anonymous) TrueCrypt authors have said “Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014). Does the cryptanalysis provided above prove or disprove this assumption?</h3>
							<h3>Would you be prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend as a secure storage environment? What caveats (if any) would you add?</h3>
							<br>
							<p>The consideration of TrueCrypt being secure or insecure depends mostly on the lack of constant updates as it has been discontinued in 2014. The longer that encryption exists, the more likely it is to be cracked. Without any updates or maintenance, the risk runs even higher. Encryption cracking technology is also advancing, meaning that encryption technology has to increase with it. Even with the consideration that TrueCrypt contains very strong encryption, as time goes on the value of these encryption is lost. </p>
							<p>TrueCrypt should not be recommended for any form of secure storage, there simply is better options that are also being maintained and improved currently. </p>
							<p>Overall, the opinions of my colleague are that TrueCrypt can possibly considered a good encryption system but due to the lack of maintenance, it should not be used or recommended to anyone for secure usage. </p>
					<h3>Why did you select the algorithm you chose?</h3>
					<br>
					<p>The chosen algorithm used was a symmetric cryptographic algorithm. This is due to having manual access to both encryption and decryption points. This ensures that the data transfer is safe, while also being simpler and faster to deploy. </p>
					<h3>Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.</h3>
					<br>
					<p>It would not meet GDPR regulations as there are no documentation of activities and processes which is required. </p>
