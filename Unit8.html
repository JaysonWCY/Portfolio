          Unit 8 - 10 Discussion
          <h3>Discussion Topic: OO Design for IoT</h3>

          <h3>
            Making reference to the article by Fortino et al. (2015), consider
            the strengths and weaknesses of designing a metamodel to support
            object-oriented design of the IoT. Design a smart model equivalent
            to that presented in Figure 6 which would instead support operation
            of a humanoid robot.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Designing a metamodel in the context of object-oriented design is a
            complementary concept, as having a basic structure that can be used
            as a foundational architecture while leaving room for alteration.
            The simplicity allows for a good communication of the design while
            also providing important context and specifications. The structure
            also provides a certain degree of flexibility to allow for changes
            throughout the design cycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Metamodels can be used to help identify and convey parts of the code
            which can be reused or restructured in a way that supports
            object-oriented design more.
          </p>

          <p>
            The weakness of metamodels is that it requires the skill and
            understanding of how to read the diagram as overall the designs tend
            to be more complicated than other possible models such as Unified
            Modelling Language (UML).
          </p>

          <p>
            Another consideration is the cost. In a huge scale project that
            evolves rapidly, maintaining and updating the model would require
            significant time and effort for each iteration. This could slow down
            development, overall increasing cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            With everything in consideration, depending on the complexity and
            requirements of the project, metamodels have the potential to be a
            useful tool that helps throughout the software development cycle as
            opposed to other models. This is more prevalent in projects with
            complex and changing requirements. This usage of metamodels,
            however, should be considered based on the needs of a project, as
            other types of models can be more efficient or simply less
            complicated to use.
          </p>

          <p>Below is an example of a metamodel for a basic humanoid robot.</p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            When comparing other peers' metamodel structures towards my own,
            overall, my design is lacking in information such as the core
            details as well as basic features. In terms of consensus about the
            usage of metamodels, everyone agreed that they should be used with
            consideration in mind, as the flexibility of the models results in
            more maintenance and complexity in a project. Overall metamodels can
            be a very useful tool that can be used depending on the situation.
            Everyone however had highlighted different parts of the pros and
            cons that they decided to put an emphasis on, such as cost as
            opposed to complexity.
